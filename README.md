# Don't Go There!!


## What is “Don’tGoThere!” ?

Don’t Go There! is a Jquery-based webapp specifically designed for users to find the WORST businesses in their city

## Functionality/Usage

1. User will see splash page upon load. They will be asked to input their query city into the searchbar
2. Upon press of the search button, the site sends a request to the UrbanDictionary API to pull up interesting definitions of their city, and the Yelp API to find the worst restaurants sorted by star-rating
3. Dynamic divs will be generated with all API content. Additional dynamic DIV’s will be generated which allow the user to pull up the reviews for each restaurant.

## Future Plans

1. Recreate the website in React
2. Add google maps functionality
3. Recreate the styling and front-end
4. Add more data sources aside from Yelp
5. Allow users to login and save their content
6. Add social media share buttons
