Application Description
____________________________

* ListenUp is an application/website that educates the hearing impaired learn the english language. This concept was thought of by one of our team members Ariel. His mom has been hearing impaired since she was born and recently just obtained a hearing aid.She is using an application that help her learn while building up her neurons in her ears, but the application she is using isn't helping her in the slightest. The programs starts of with the lessons having full on conversation making it hars for her learn and build up her hearing. So Ariel's idea is was make simple starting from Basic language that child starts off at. Lessons start from Vowels, Basic Words, and Basics Sayings, more lessons can be added later.
