Application Description
____________________________

* ListenUp is an application/website that educates the hearing impaired learn the english language. This concept was thought of by one of our team members, Ariel. His mom has been hearing impaired since she was born and recently just obtained a cochlear implant. She was recommended an app for Audio Verbal Therapy by the hospital that performed her surgery, but the application she is using has multiple major design flaws and exposed that there is a market need for an AVT app for CI patients. The program that she was recommended by her hospital starts off with the lessons having full on conversations, rather than building up to that difficulty level - making it hard for her learn and build up her hearing. Ariel's idea was to make an application that started from the simple sounds that a child begins their language development at, and progressing gradually from there. Lessons start from Vowels, Basic Words, and Basics Sayings, more lessons will be added later.
